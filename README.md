## How to play

Your goal is to get the highest score by making long chains. Selecting an enemy will lock your chain into that color, and you may then jump to any of that enemy's neighbors, including diagonals.

Press the Go button to lock in your chain and destroy the selected enemies.

## Development

You must have the Chrome browser installed.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the webserver.
3. Launch the debugging configuration from VSCode to open Chrome to the appropriate URL if you want to be able to debug in VSCode (set breakpoints, etc.), or open the URL given from the last step to use any browser without debugging.
